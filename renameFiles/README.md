# renameFiles

A Powershell Program to renameFiles in a Folderstructure

Modify skript.ps1 with the extensionToBeUsed and the targetFolder on which the files are stored

To run the skript execute this:
<code>
.\skript.ps1
</code>

This will then iterate the folder defined in targetFolder and retrieves every file and renames it based on the extensionToBeUsed appended to the name of the directory which contains the file.
